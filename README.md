HLCV-project
============

Fine-grained classification on UCSD_CUB_200_2011 dataset - HLCV final project

Make sure you have the CUB_200_2011 folder at the root (avoiding uploading large files to the repo)
All the codes is prefered to run from one level deep in the rrot i.e. by creating a folder and having funcs and scripts there.
For playing around, use a folder named "mock". This folder won't get tracked by git.
