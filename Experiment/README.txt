Note: 
You need to be in the Experiment folder. 

Then:
1.Open the Experiment script
2.Run it
3.Experiment with different values for the part (1-15) and different percentages for width and height. 
For optimal percentages values per part-- See below)

Output:
Should get ten (10) randomly generated images and the patches
around the specified parts.

Percentages:
Find the optimal (best) percentages in the percentage text file.
Here is the structure of the percentage text file data.

<part_id> <best_percentage_width> <best_percentage_height>

Parts for training classifier:
Use these parts: 2, 3, 4, 14, 15 for training the classifier. They seem to be quite discriminative (According to my study of the dataset images)
